I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics, at the University of Alberta, and a member of the [Centre for Comparative Psycholinguistics](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/ccp/home) and the [Heritage Language Lab](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/heritagelanguagelab/home).

My doctoral research focuses on the role of information structure and implicit causality in co-reference processing in English and Spanish.

In addition, I am part of a project that studies cross-linguistic influence and environmental factors with Spanish-English bilinguals in Western Canada.
